Are you tired of having to mouse over each SellStick just to see how many uses it has? This pack is just for you!

# Requirements
- Optifine or MCPatcher

# Installation
1. Download the pack from the [releases](https://github.com/aembur/sellstick-uses-pack/releases).
	- If your version isn't there, download any pack, then edit the `pack.mcmeta` file, and change `pack_format` to one corresponding with your Minecraft version. See [here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Pack_format) for the value you should use.
2. Place the file in your `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder.
3. In Minecraft, go to `Options > Resource Packs` and move the `SellStick Uses` pack to the **Selected Resource Packs**.
4. Make sure **Custom Items** are turned **ON** in `Options > Video Settings > Quality`.

# Generating your own pack
If you want to change the stick image or the colours of the numbers, you can do so by changing the textures in the `resource` folder.
Afterwards, run `generate.py -p [pack format]` to generate a pack.
